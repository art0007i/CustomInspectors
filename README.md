# CustomInspectors

A [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader) mod for [Neos VR](https://neos.com/) that allows you to favorite inspector panels by saving them and clicking the purple heart.<br>
Make sure to wait for it to finish syncing before favoriting or it won't work!

## Installation
1. Install [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader).
1. Place [CustomInspectors.dll](https://github.com/art0007i/CustomInspectors/releases/latest/download/CustomInspectors.dll) into your `nml_mods` folder. This folder should be at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\NeosVR\nml_mods` for a default install. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with NeosModLoader installed it will create the folder for you.
1. Start the game. If you want to verify that the mod is working you can check your Neos logs.
