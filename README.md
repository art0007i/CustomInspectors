# CustomInspectors

## This mod requires [SpecialItemsLib](https://github.com/art0007i/SpecialItemsLib) to work

A [ResoniteModLoader](https://github.com/resonite-modding-group/ResoniteModLoader) mod for [Resonite](https://resonite.com/) that allows you to use custom inspector panels by saving them and clicking the purple heart.<br>
Make sure to wait for it to finish syncing before favoriting or it won't work!<br>
The `SceneInspector` component MUST be on the top level slot of the inspector, but most should be doing that anyway.

## Installation
1. Install [ResoniteModLoader](https://github.com/resonite-modding-group/ResoniteModLoader).
1. Place [CustomInspectors.dll](https://github.com/art0007i/CustomInspectors/releases/latest/download/CustomInspectors.dll) into your `rml_mods` folder. This folder should be at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Resonite\rml_mods` for a default install. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with ResoniteModLoader installed it will create the folder for you.
1. Place [SpecialItemsLib.dll](https://github.com/art0007i/SpecialItemsLib/releases/latest/download/SpecialItemsLib.dll) into your `rml_mods` folder.
1. Start the game. If you want to verify that the mod is working you can check your Resonite logs.
